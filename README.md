# This is a repo holding my personal work for the DESY summer camp.

During my stay in Hamburg I have helped a research team at DESY to implement a Ring Polymer Molecular Dynamics symulation. I've worked there for roughly 3 months at the end of my bachelor and implemented in their code a few algorithms that I have personally created in order to impose certain constraint to the simulation and also optimized their code in a few ways. In this repo is contained not their code (which is private) but what I used to test out my algorithm, a toy model usefull for performing generic Path Integral Molecular Dynamics symulation (In practice is a complete molecular dynamics symulation but without a tuning of the parameters to represent a realistic physical model).

There are three 'front end' files (not really) which are used respectively to setup the system, run it and visualize the results:
1. setting.py : Here all the relevant properties of the system can be setted
2. main.py
3. Visualizer.py
